{"id":"bd-1lm","title":"Feature: Configuration File Support","description":"# Feature: Configuration File Support\n\n## Problem Statement\n\nCurrently asb uses environment variables (ASB_BACKUP_ROOT, ASB_AUTO_COMMIT, ASB_VERBOSE) for\nconfiguration. This approach has significant UX problems:\n\n1. **Invisible**: Users can't easily see what's configured\n2. **Transient**: Settings don't persist across shell sessions unless manually added to RC files\n3. **Scattered**: Users forget where they set variables\n4. **Not self-documenting**: No comments explaining options\n5. **Not portable**: Can't easily transfer settings between machines\n\n## Solution\n\nImplement a configuration file at ~/.config/asb/config (XDG-compliant) that:\n- Is sourced at startup (it's just bash, so compatible with env vars)\n- Takes precedence over environment variables when both exist\n- Is self-documenting with comments\n- Can be created with `asb config init`\n- Can be viewed with `asb config show`\n\n## Technical Design\n\n### Config File Location\n```\n${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}/asb/config\n```\n\n### Config File Format (bash-sourceable)\n```bash\n# asb configuration file\n# Generated by: asb config init\n# Documentation: asb help\n\n# Backup location (default: ~/.agent_settings_backups)\nASB_BACKUP_ROOT=\"$HOME/.agent_settings_backups\"\n\n# Auto-commit on backup (default: true)  \nASB_AUTO_COMMIT=true\n\n# Verbose output (default: false)\nASB_VERBOSE=false\n\n# Future: custom exclusion patterns, agent definitions, etc.\n```\n\n### New Functions\n\n1. `get_config_dir()` - Returns XDG-compliant config directory\n2. `get_config_file()` - Returns path to config file\n3. `load_config()` - Sources config file if it exists\n4. `init_config()` - Creates default config file with comments\n5. `show_config()` - Displays current effective configuration\n\n### New Subcommands\n\n- `asb config` - Show current config (alias for `asb config show`)\n- `asb config init` - Create default config file\n- `asb config show` - Display effective settings\n- `asb config edit` - Open config in $EDITOR (optional nice-to-have)\n\n## Implementation Notes\n\n- Config file is sourced AFTER constants but BEFORE command parsing\n- Environment variables still work (for CI/scripts) but config file takes precedence\n- If config file doesn't exist, behavior is unchanged (backward compatible)\n- The config file itself should be valid bash to allow complex expressions\n\n## Why This Is Foundational\n\nOther features may want configuration options:\n- Dry-run could have a default mode setting\n- Shell completion might have customization\n- Import/export could have default archive location\n\nHaving the config infrastructure first enables cleaner implementation of other features.\n\n## Testing Checklist\n\n- [ ] Config file is created in correct XDG location\n- [ ] Config file is sourced at startup\n- [ ] Config values override defaults\n- [ ] Env vars still work when config doesn't exist\n- [ ] Config precedence: config file > env var > default\n- [ ] `asb config init` is idempotent (doesn't overwrite existing)\n- [ ] `asb config show` displays all effective settings","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2026-01-19T21:21:38.822857328Z","created_by":"ubuntu","updated_at":"2026-01-20T04:01:14.065352685Z","closed_at":"2026-01-20T04:01:14.065220226Z","compaction_level":0,"original_size":0,"dependencies":[{"issue_id":"bd-1lm","depends_on_id":"bd-3u9","type":"parent-child","created_at":"2026-01-19T21:21:38.851021296Z","created_by":"ubuntu"}]}

Static list is better.\n\n### Dynamic Commit Completion\n\nFor `asb restore <agent> <TAB>`, we dynamically list recent commits.\nThis requires:\n- Knowing the backup directory path\n- Git access\n- Limiting to recent commits (10-20) for performance\n\n## Testing Checklist\n\n- [ ] Bash completion works\n- [ ] Zsh completion works  \n- [ ] Fish completion works\n- [ ] Commands complete correctly\n- [ ] Agent names complete correctly\n- [ ] File completion works for import\n- [ ] Commit completion works for restore\n- [ ] Completion installation instructions in help","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2026-01-19T21:26:21.785322398Z","created_by":"ubuntu","updated_at":"2026-01-20T04:01:00.585570089Z","closed_at":"2026-01-20T04:01:00.585446056Z","compaction_level":0,"original_size":0,"dependencies":[{"issue_id":"bd-39b","depends_on_id":"bd-1lm","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-19T21:29:31.582580519Z","created_by":"ubuntu"},{"issue_id":"bd-39b","depends_on_id":"bd-26s","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-19T21:29:31.757914369Z","created_by":"ubuntu"},{"issue_id":"bd-39b","depends_on_id":"bd-3co","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-19T21:29:31.919959949Z","created_by":"ubuntu"},{"issue_id":"bd-39b","depends_on_id":"bd-3u9","type":"parent-child","created_at":"2026-01-19T21:26:21.803659376Z","created_by":"ubuntu"},{"issue_id":"bd-39b","depends_on_id":"bd-v3p","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-19T21:29:32.081521498Z","created_by":"ubuntu"}]}

Configuration file (foundational - other features may use settings)\n2. Dry-run mode (standalone, simple, builds confidence)\n3. Conflict detection (standalone, critical safety)\n4. Import/export (adds new commands)\n5. Shell completion (LAST - needs to know all final commands)\n\n## Success Criteria\n\n- All five features implemented and tested\n- README updated with new features\n- AGENTS.md updated with new functions/patterns\n- VERSION bumped to 0.2.0\n- No regressions in existing functionality","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"epic","created_at":"2026-01-19T21:21:18.244580059Z","created_by":"ubuntu","updated_at":"2026-01-20T04:14:04.042666793Z","closed_at":"2026-01-20T04:14:04.042625575Z","close_reason":"All five core features implemented and tested: Conflict Detection, Dry-Run Mode, Shell Completion, Config File Support, Import/Export Archives","compaction_level":0,"original_size":0}

{"id":"bd-v3p","title":"Feature: Import/Export Archives","description":"# Feature: Import/Export Archives\n\n## Problem Statement\n\nBackups that can't be moved are only half useful. Real-world scenarios where portability matters:\n\n1. **New machine setup**: User gets a new laptop, wants to bring agent configs\n2. **Sharing configs**: Team wants to share a known-good Claude setup\n3. **Disaster recovery**: User's home directory is corrupted, but they emailed an archive\n4. **Cross-platform**: User switches from Linux to Mac\n5. **Backup redundancy**: User wants to store backups in cloud storage\n\nWithout export/import, users must manually tar directories, figure out paths, and hope for the best.\n\n## Solution\n\nAdd two new commands:\n- `asb export <agent> [file]` - Creates portable tar.gz archive with full git history\n- `asb import <file>` - Restores archive to backup location\n\n## Technical Design\n\n### Export Command\n\n```bash\nasb export claude                    # Creates claude-backup-20240115.tar.gz\nasb export claude my-backup.tar.gz   # Creates my-backup.tar.gz\nasb export claude -                  # Writes to stdout (for piping)\n```\n\n### Import Command\n\n```bash\nasb import my-backup.tar.gz          # Imports to backup location\nasb import -                         # Reads from stdin (for piping)\n```\n\n### Archive Format\n\nThe archive is a standard tar.gz containing:\n```\n.claude/\n├── .git/           # Full git history preserved!\n├── .gitignore\n├── settings.json\n└── ...\n```\n\nThe directory name tells us which agent it is.\n\n### Implementation\n\n**export_backup()**\n```bash\nexport_backup() {\n    local agent=\"$1\"\n    local output=\"${2:-}\"\n    local agent_name=\"${AGENT_NAMES[$agent]:-$agent}\"\n    local source\n    source=$(get_agent_backup_dir \"$agent\")\n    \n    if [[ ! -d \"$source/.git\" ]]; then\n        log_error \"No backup found for ${agent_name}\"\n        return 1\n    fi\n    \n    # Generate default filename if not specified\n    if [[ -z \"$output\" ]]; then\n        output=\"${agent}-backup-$(date +%Y%m%d).tar.gz\"\n    fi\n    \n    log_step \"Exporting ${agent_name} to ${output}...\"\n    \n    # Create archive preserving git history\n    local backup_root\n    backup_root=$(get_backup_root)\n    local folder=\"${AGENT_FOLDERS[$agent]}\"\n    \n    if [[ \"$output\" == \"-\" ]]; then\n        # Write to stdout\n        tar -czf - -C \"$backup_root\" \"$folder\"\n    else\n        tar -czf \"$output\" -C \"$backup_root\" \"$folder\"\n        \n        local size\n        size=$(du -h \"$output\" | cut -f1)\n        log_success \"Exported ${agent_name} (${size})\"\n        log_info \"File: $(realpath \"$output\")\"\n    fi\n}\n```\n\n**import_backup()**\n```bash\nimport_backup() {\n    local archive=\"$1\"\n    local backup_root\n    backup_root=$(get_backup_root)\n    \n    if [[ \"$archive\" != \"-\" ]] && [[ ! -f \"$archive\" ]]; then\n        log_error \"Archive not found: ${archive}\"\n        return 1\n    fi\n    \n    log_step \"Importing from ${archive}...\"\n    \n    # Create backup location if needed\n    mkdir -p \"$backup_root\"\n    \n    # Extract archive\n    if [[ \"$archive\" == \"-\" ]]; then\n        tar -xzf - -C \"$backup_root\"\n    else\n        tar -xzf \"$archive\" -C \"$backup_root\"\n    fi\n    \n    log_success \"Imported backup to ${backup_root}\"\n    log_info \"Run 'asb list' to see imported backups\"\n}\n```\n\n## Important Considerations\n\n### Git History Preservation\n\nThe entire .git directory is included in the archive. This means:\n- Full backup history is preserved\n- Can be used immediately after import\n- No need to re-initialize or lose history\n\n### Conflict Handling\n\nIf the agent already has a backup at the destination:\n- Show warning\n- Require --force to overwrite\n- Or prompt for confirmation in interactive mode\n\n### Stdin/Stdout Support\n\nThe \"-\" argument enables piping:\n```bash\n# Remote transfer\nasb export claude - | ssh remote \"asb import -\"\n\n# S3 backup\nasb export claude - | aws s3 cp - s3://bucket/claude-backup.tar.gz\n\n# Encryption\nasb export claude - | gpg -c > claude-backup.tar.gz.gpg\n```\n\n## Testing Checklist\n\n- [ ] Export creates valid tar.gz\n- [ ] Export includes .git directory\n- [ ] Import extracts to correct location\n- [ ] Imported backup works with asb history\n- [ ] Default filename includes date\n- [ ] Custom filename works\n- [ ] Stdout/stdin piping works\n- [ ] Dry-run shows what would be exported/imported\n- [ ] Force flag handles conflicts","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2026-01-19T21:25:14.535112113Z","created_by":"ubuntu","updated_at":"2026-01-20T04:25:47.494362932Z","closed_at":"2026-01-20T04:25:47.494272021Z","compaction_level":0,"original_size":0,"dependencies":[{"issue_id":"bd-v3p","depends_on_id":"bd-3u9","type":"parent-child","created_at":"2026-01-19T21:25:14.550127646Z","created_by":"ubuntu"}]}
